# win10-optimisation
Collection of all windows 10 optimisations I know of.

## About
This is my collection of windows 10 optimisation scripts & guides that includes a master guide.  
The guide.txt contains different steps with a guide on how to do them. You can do any of the steps you like but I recommend doing all of them; in order from top to bottom.  
Download the repo & follow guide.txt to do the optimisations.

## Branches
Main branch can be considered stable.  
cooper-lockrey branch will probably be more up to date and should still work fine (unless I accidentally commit bogus changes).
