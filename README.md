# crispy-win10-optimisation
Collection of windows 10 optimisations including other repositories

## About
This is my collection of windows 10 optimisation scripts & guides that includes a master guide. Requires Git for the download scripts to function correctly (link is in guide.txt).
The guide.txt contains different steps with a guide on how to do them. You can do any of the steps you like but I recommend doing them in order from top to bottom.

## Branches
Main branch can be considered stable.  
cooper-lockrey branch will probably be more up to date and should still work fine (unless I accidentally commit bogus changes).
