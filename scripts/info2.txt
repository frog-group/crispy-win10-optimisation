In the form entitled "Windows10Debloater", I recommend at least clicking:
	REMOVE ALL BLOATWARE
	DISABLE - under "CORTANA"
	DISABLE - under "EDGE PDF" [UNLESS YOU USE EDGE, IN WHICH CASE DO NOT CLICK THIS]
	UNINSTALL ONEDRIVE
	UNPIN TILES FROM START MENU
	DISABLE TELEMETRY/TASKS
	REMOVE BLOATWARE REGKEYS

I have not tested the .NET V3.5 install button, but I would assume it works and as such feel free to use it.
