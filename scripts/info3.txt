Now, again you should run:
"Essential Tweaks", "Action Center", "Background Apps", "Cortana",
"OneDrive"(CHECK IF YOU HAVE ONEDRIVE DOCUMENTS ON YOUR PC -- THEY WILL BE DELETED SO BACK THEM UP FIRST),
"Visual FX", "Windows Search" & "Security Updates Only".

This time, MAKE SURE TO RUN "High" under "Security".
