In the form entitled "Windows 10 Debloat by Chris Titus", I recommend at least clicking:
	Essential Tweaks
	Disable Action Center
	Disable Background Apps
	Disable Cortana (Search)
	Uninstall OneDrive [CAUTION - BACK UP ANY FILES THAT ARE CURRENTLY SAVED IN THE ONEDRIVE DIRECTORY, CAN PROBABLY RETRIEVE FROM ONLINE - UNTESTED!]
	Basic Visual FX
	Remove MS Store Apps [CAUTION - WILL CAUSE GAMES THAT USE XBOX LIVE TO FAIL LOGGING IN, CAN BE FIXED BY REINSTALLING IT]
	Security Updates Only

Feel free to enable dark/light mode as you see fit (by default on Windows 10 light mode is enabled).
Also the app install buttons at the very left do work, you can use those if you're on a fresh install.
